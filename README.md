# Varexp

This Gem will export your environment variables to CSV. It requires the 'csv' gem, which is built-in in Ruby 2.0, 
therefore installation on a Ruby version other than 2.0 will probably fail =(

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'varexp'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install varexp
